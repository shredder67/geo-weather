# geo-weather
compact Windows to retrieve weather by your GPS location
# About
This project was created for learning purposes: usage of best OOP design practices, latest Python linting features and working
with REST API for retrieving weather data. It doesn't require any additional packages to run locally, however ```config.py``` with my pesronal openweather
url is not present for obvious reasons.

_Note_: Current version works only on Windows, Linux/MacOS need little extension in ```coordinates.py``` and platform specific shell scripts. Feel free to
pull request if interested :)
